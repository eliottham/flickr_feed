	This is a project to learn about working with third party APIs. In this project
I use Flickr's API to retrieve the photo stream of a specified user. This is a 
project taken from The Odin Project curriculum. More information about it can be
found at https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/apis?ref=lc-pb.
